# UR-Scraped #
## website scraper written in python ##

you will need to install the required libraries
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then just run the script 
```
  python UR-scraped.py
```
To build a Binary with all dependancies
```
  pyinstaller --onefile UR-scraped.py
```
Its not perfect, but I will continue to work on it.
